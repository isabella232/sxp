# Installing

Upon purchasing a premium subscription you will receive an authentication token. This you will need for the following steps.

## 1. `.npmrc`

In order to download the premium packages you need to add an `.npmrc` file or edit your existing one. Exchange `${SX_PREMIUM_TOKEN}` with your actual token. This can also be done via environment variables.

```
@sx-premium:registry=https://npm.schedule-x.dev
//npm.schedule-x.dev/:_authToken=${SX_PREMIUM_TOKEN}
```

## 2. Install the packages

```
npm i @sx-premium/interactive-event-modal
```

and/or:

```
npm i @sx-premium/sidebar
```
